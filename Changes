Version History
---------------

2004.03.03 - 0.99b5
  - Merge two new features proposed by Vladi Belperchinov-Shabanski: 
    method param_tree(), which returns a tree giving direct access to 
    the internal tree, and the 'strip_indentation' to automatically 
    strip indentation from multilines values. 
  - Corrected a small bug in AUTOLOAD. 

2004.02.03 - 0.99b4
  - Corrected a big dumb bug (probably present since a long time): creating
