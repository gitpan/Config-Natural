As this module was previously known as Data::Config, I provide 
here a compatibility module.  To install it, simply copy it to 
the Data/ subdirectory of your site_perl directory. 

    $ cp Data/Config.pm $site_perl/Data/

If you have already installed Config::Natural, you can then 
check that the compatibility module works by running the test.pl
script.
