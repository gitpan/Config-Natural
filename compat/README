BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY

   As this module was previously known as Data::Config, I provide 
   here a compatibility module.  To install it, first install 
   Config::Natural, then simply copy the file Data/Config.pm to 
   the Data/ subdirectory of your site_perl directory. 
   
       $ cp Data/Config.pm $site_perl/Data/
   
   You can then check that the compatibility module works by running 
   the test.pl script. 
   
   By default, this compatibility module will print a warning message
   upon loading.  If this bothers you, you can simply delete the 
   carp() call in Data/Config.pm.
