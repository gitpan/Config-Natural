NAME
    Config::Natural - Module that can read easy-to-use configuration files

DESCRIPTION
    You can use this module to read generic configuration files based 
    on a one key-value pair per line. It has very few constraints on 
    the data and has support for multi-lines values. It also supports 
    nested lists. 

    Its object oriented API is compatible with modules like CGI or 
    HTML::Template, and can be safely associate()d with this last one.
